# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster 🚢

This repository contains my solution for the [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic) competition hosted on Kaggle. The goal is to build a predictive model that answers the question: **"What sorts of people were more likely to survive?"**

## 🧠 Problem Statement

The Titanic dataset is used to predict the survival of passengers based on features such as age, sex, class, and other variables. It is a classic binary classification task.
